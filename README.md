### Abstract
One-class video anomaly detection (OC-VAD) detects all events outside the learned distribution as anomalies and requires costly model retraining to redefine what is considered anomalous. Moreover, most existing methods lack the flexibility to incorporate the prior knowledge that human surveillance operators often have about specific anomalies they wish to flag or ignore. To address these challenges, we propose LinGuard (Language-guided anomaly guard), a method that lets users dynamically redefine anomaly/normality judgments at inference time by providing an Event Prompt—a language description of events that should be treated as normal or anomalous—without retraining. LinGuard fuses the anomaly score from a pre-trained OC-VAD backbone with a similarity-based score computed between the Event Prompt and event captions generated by a large vision language model (LVLM). We evaluate LinGuard on standard OC-VAD and general action recognition datasets under challenging conditions where normal/anomalous event set changes during test time. Experiments demonstrate that LinGuard can flexibly redefine user-specified events as normal or anomalous, effectively handling both unknown and known anomalies while eliminating retraining costs. Our code and model will be released upon acceptance.

### Code Release Status
The implementation code is currently under preparation and will be released soon.
